Last week, I overheard something that stuck with me.
Two students were comparing holiday wishlists when one said:
“I love giving gifts, but I can’t afford to get it wrong this year.”
That line sums up how many people are approaching the holidays in 2025 — still excited to give, but far more intentional with every purchase.
And the data reflects it:
72% are prioritizing value over brand names.
Nearly half start browsing before November ends.
Most want tools that save time, money, and stress.
That’s exactly why we built.
Instead of opening ten tabs, hunting for “dupes,” or scrolling for hours,lets you paste a link and instantly get cheaper, better-value alternatives.
Because smart shopping shouldn’t feel like a full-time job.
This holiday season, people aren’t just chasing deals —
they’re trying to shop smarter.
is here to help them do exactly that.

Meet Lesley Smith & the Rhodes, Young, Black & Duncan, CPAs Team ✨

We love celebrating our amazing customers, and today we’re shining the spotlight on, VP of Operations at

Lesley’s firm is a 30+ person powerhouse that blends sharp technical skills with a warm, people-first culture. But before Canopy, they were juggling:
• Multiple disconnected systems
• Limited visibility into projects and performance
• Communication bottlenecks

Lesley’s words:

“We needed one place to manage time & billing, workflow, communications, proposals — everything. With Canopy, our team and our clients get a smoother, more connected experience.”

Her favorite parts of Canopy?
💬 Comments panel — quick answers without endless email chains
⚙️ Workflow automations & notifications — keeping projects moving
✍️ E-sign — documents sent, signed, and stored in a snap
📊 Insights — smarter decisions, backed by data

The results?
Everything’s in one place. Projects are crystal clear. And the team’s working together better than ever.

Lesley’s tip for other firms:

“Have someone really own the implementation. We made micro-tutorials to help our team learn — and showed them exactly how Canopy makes their work easier.”

Big thanks to Lesley and the entire RYBD team! We’re so glad to be part of your journey! 🙌

Here's why 99% of your cold emails are landing in spam folders.

You're probably doing what everyone else does.

Copy a template from ChatGPT or some blog post.

Change the first name.

Blast it to thousands of prospects.

But here's the problem that most people miss.

When you send the same email template hundreds of times, email providers like Google and Microsoft use AI bots to detect this pattern.

They see thousands of identical emails and immediately flag it as automated spam.

Game over before you even started.

The solution is surprisingly simple though.

It's called spintax (spinning syntax).

Instead of writing "Hi [Name]" every time, you write it like this:

[Hi|Hey|Hello] [Name]

The email software randomly picks one variation for each email sent.

So one person gets "Hi John" while another gets "Hey Sarah."

Let me show you the math that changes everything.

If you add 3 greeting variations, 2 call-to-action options, and 2 different time frames, you get 12 unique email combinations (3 × 2 × 2 = 12).

Scale this up with 5 different spintax elements, each with 3 variations, and you're looking at hundreds of unique emails.

The spam filters see this diversity and think "these look manually written" instead of "obvious automation."

Your deliverability shoots up dramatically.

Here's your action step for this week.

Take your current cold email template and identify 3-5 phrases you can spin.

Add spintax variations to each one.

Test it on a small batch first.

Most email platforms support this feature, and if yours doesn't, it's time to switch.

Despite EU's "AI first" Strategy presented by Ursula von der Leyen, high energy costs & bureaucracy have so far inhibited Germany's build-out of AI datacenters at scale. 

The comparison isn't even close. 12 MW vs 16,140 MW until 2026 🤯 

"We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much" - Sam Altman

📚 
A single NextGen 1 GW AI Datacenter has a total investment budget of circa $45 Bn USD and would increase German GDP by 1% (assuming no imports)

Had a great time at CalHacks 12.0 learning from and giving to Pranav Kannepalli and Cam Malloy! We built LaserLock, a real-time productivity tracker designed to help students & writers see when and why their focus slips.

A Python desktop agent ran locally, using OpenCV and MediaPipe to track eye movement and attention, while PyWin monitored active windows. Each activity stream ran through Claude, which classified it as productive, unproductive, or neutral, then pushed session summaries to Firebase. From there, we extracted distraction windows and surfaced analytics on when you lose focus, what breaks it, and how to structure smarter work sessions. On the front end, we prototyped in Figma and built a clean React + Tailwind dashboard, complete with daily insights, streak tracking, and robust  gamification: XP, levels, leaderboards, and achievements that make productivity feel like progress.

From my end, I learned a lot about balancing performance and clarity under time pressure. Contributing to the backend forced me to think about how to efficiently capture, process, and store high-frequency behavioral data without overloading the system. I got hands-on experience combining computer vision   with window tracking and AI classification in real time, then designing a Firebase schema that could turn raw data into meaningful analytics. It was a wonderful introduction to end-to-end development, laying a foundation for much more to come.

What started as a 48-hour hackathon sprint became the foundation for a focus intelligence platform — one that blends computer vision, behavioral analytics, and smart design to help creators stay in flow and have fun doing it. Looking forward to packaging LaserLock with Electron to finish its development cycle!

Today we announced our new Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, connected with our first Fairwater site in Wisconsin and our broader Azure footprint to create the world’s first AI superfactory.

Fairwater exemplifies our vision for a fungible fleet: infra that can serve any workload, anywhere, on fit-for-purpose accelerators and network paths, with maximum performance and efficiency.

AI workloads have evolved beyond large-scale pre-training. Today, they encompass fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), synthetic data generation, evaluation pipelines, and more. Fairwater is built to support this full lifecycle:

Max density: Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling system lets us place racks in three dimensions and pack them with GPUs as densely as possible, minimizing cable runs and improving latency and effective bandwidth.

Fleet: Each Fairwater DC can integrate hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs into a single coherent cluster. This provides flexible infra that can support the full spectrum of workloads, and ensure no GPU is left unnecessarily idle.

And that’s on top of the more than 100,000 GB300s coming online this quarter alone for inference across the rest of our fleet. For us, it’s all about turning every gigawatt into the maximum number of useful tokens. Not every GW is created equal!

Planet-scale: Every Fairwater DC will connect through our continent-spanning AI WAN to prior generations of AI supercomputers, forming a truly fungible pool of compute. This enables developers to scale beyond the capacity of a single site and dynamically land workloads on the right infra for their needs.

Together, these innovations let us bring together different generations of silicon and AI systems across DCs and geos into a single elastic system that scales seamlessly across training and inference workloads

And this elastic AI capacity is all available alongside all the other cloud services (compute, storage, databases, app services) that AI agents and workloads need.

This is what we mean when we talk about building a fungible fleet – a single, unified platform that pushes the limits of performance per watt and per dollar.

The psychology of a disorganized person involves a combination of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional factors, which can stem from a lack of skills, certain mental health conditions like ADHD or depression, or a history of trauma. Common signs include trouble with focus, time management, and prioritizing tasks, which often leads to frustration, anxiety, and feelings of overwhelm. While disorganization can range from everyday messiness to severe behavioral inconsistencies, it can also be associated with a disorganized attachment style and may, in its most extreme forms (often seen in conditions like schizophrenia), involve erratic and unusual behaviors.  
Behavioral and cognitive factors
Trouble with executive functions: A disorganized person may struggle with planning, time management, and prioritizing tasks, leading to procrastination and difficulty completing projects. 
Lack of focus: They can be easily distracted by their environment, feelings, or thoughts, making it hard to concentrate and leading to reduced efficiency and decision-making ability. 
Cognitive overload: Clutter and disorganization can have a cumulative effect on the brain, draining cognitive resources and reducing the ability to focus and remember things. 
Inconsistent behavior: In some cases, disorganization can manifest as self-contradictory or inconsistent actions, such as dressing inappropriately for the weather, which is sometimes seen in conditions like schizophrenia. 
Emotional factors
Negative emotions: Disorganization is often accompanied by significant negative emotions like frustration, anxiety, guilt, shame, and overwhelm. 
Negative self-view: A disorganized attachment style, often linked to a history of inconsistent or frightening caregiving, is associated with a negative view of both oneself and others. 
Potential causes
Mental health conditions: Disorganization can be a symptom of various conditions, including ADHD, depression, and, in more severe cases, schizophrenia. 
Lack of skills: Sometimes disorganization is due to a simple lack of learned skills rather than a deeper psychological issue. 
Trauma and attachment: A history of trauma, unresolved loss, or abuse can contribute to disorganization, particularly a disorganized attachment style. 
Perfectionism: Interestingly, perfectionism can also be a cause of disorganization, as it can lead to indecision and a fear of starting tasks.

Starting My Journey into Cold Emails

I’ve always heard founders and agency owners talk about how cold emails transformed their business.
Now, I’m finally diving in — and beginning to understand why.

Here’s what I’ve learned so far 

1.Setting up domains & DNS records — to make sure emails actually land in inboxes
2. Using tools like Instantly, Apollo & Clay — for building targeted, verified lead lists
3. Writing short, human, and relevant cold emails — not spam blasts

. My goals right now are simple:
1. Learn by doing
2. Share what’s working (and what’s not)
3. Connect with people who’ve already mastered this craft

If you’re an agency owner or someone experienced in cold outreach, I’d love to connect, learn, and exchange ideas.

 What’s one piece of advice you wish you knew when you first started sending cold emails?

That’s where pooling layers come in.

Think of them like zooming out...
They help AI 
- step back, 
- filter the noise, 
- and focus on the big picture.

By compressing huge scans, pooling layers make analysis faster —
So patients get results sooner.

They also help AI generalize —
Whether the image comes from 
A 20-year-old or 
an 80-year-old?

And when combined with convolutional networks,
They help detect subtle patterns
The kind that might otherwise
Slip past even trained eyes.

AI doesn’t just see better.
It learns how to look. 👀

Let’s be honest - how many times has this happened?

You get assigned a research task during your internship, and once you sit down to start, you’re suddenly blank.

“𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯?”

“𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘹𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘪𝘵 𝘪𝘯?”

𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘷𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘺𝘴, ‘𝘐𝘧 𝘐 𝘨𝘰 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘴𝘬, 𝘐’𝘭𝘭 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘥𝘶𝘮𝘣!’

Trust me - you’re not alone.
Every intern (including me!) has been through this at least once.

So here’s what actually works - 

1. 𝑨𝒍𝒘𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒚 𝒂 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒑𝒂𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒑𝒆𝒏.
𝒀𝒆𝒔, 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒔 𝒔𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆, 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒊𝒕 𝒔𝒂𝒗𝒆𝒔 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒃𝒊𝒈 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆.

2. 𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒘𝒏 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒍𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒐𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒕𝒆/𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒕𝒏𝒆𝒓 𝒊𝒔 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌. 𝑫𝒐𝒏’𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒚 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆-𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒘𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒆.

3. 𝑳𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒓, 𝒔𝒊𝒕 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒔 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒎𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎. 𝑻𝒓𝒚 𝒕𝒐 𝒖𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒙𝒕, 𝒊𝒔𝒔𝒖𝒆, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒍𝒚 𝒚𝒐𝒖’𝒓𝒆 𝒔𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒅.

Still confused? Confirm!

Message or go back to your senior and say -  “This is what I understood. Am I on the right track?” (𝘐𝘵 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘧𝘶𝘭 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦, 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴.)

Once it’s clear - start your research.

For me, I was recently juggling multiple research propositions - read the IA, replies, annexures, and finally everything made sense. But before moving ahead, I confirmed with my senior if I was interpreting it right.

That helped me not only in the research but also while drafting the rejoinder later.

𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝒕𝒊𝒑: 𝑵𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓 𝒉𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒂𝒔𝒌 𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔.

Proud to share some great news from our Microsoft partnership with Boeing.

As some of you may know, the aviation industry faces a big challenge ahead.’s latest outlook shows the world will need roughly 660,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. That’s a huge demand for talent and a clear signal that training must evolve.

’s new Virtual Airplane Procedures Trainer is a step in that direction to evolve. Pilots can practice more often and in more places, and training teams can shape lessons to what their people actually need. It starts with the 737 MAX, and it will only grow from here.

From ourperspective, the future of aviation training is digitally connected and tuned to the people doing the work. When technology connects with pilots where they are, learning becomes more intuitive, with skills built faster with higher confidence and safety in flight for pilots and passengers.

That’s the future we want to help deliver with partners like… Innovative tools, top preparation, and increased opportunities for future generations.
We're grateful for the teamwork that brought this exciting announcement to life, including,,,,and’s,,, and.

In addition to pilot training, there is a significant opportunity to leverage technology for training aerospace assemblers, technicians, and mechanics. These skilled professionals are responsible for physically building aircraft.

Having conducted Gemba walks and delivered training sessions within the aerospace industry, I can confidently state that investing in technology and utilizing AI to generate training materials can greatly enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
